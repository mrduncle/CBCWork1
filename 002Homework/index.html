                                I have been programming as a sideline to my normal engineering job since teaching
                                myself VBA for Excel in 2002. Once I developed enough confidence in my programming
                                skills I would find myself encountering problems in my normal role that I could see
                                a solution for. Then in my own time, I would set about resolving a programmatic answer
                                to the problem. I still find myself as excited today about my latest programs as I was
                                upon completing my first program and demonstrating it in a weekly meeting to my peers 
                                and managers (with the screen updating deliberately left on). I find it immensely
                                satisfying to create programs that will accomplish in a few seconds what would take
                                hours or even days to perform manually.

                                I have continued my self learning in the art of programming with Python, T-SQL, Access
                                VBA along with supporting programs and technologies such as Visual Studio and Git. For
                                the first time in my part time amateur programming career I am taking a course on full
                                stack web development. I am very excited to finally have people to learn with as I
                                struggle with a new bunch of languages.

                                For me, it's all about the creative solutions you can bring to make the world a better
                                place...or at least make someone's life a little easier. I also like whitewater kayaking.
