                            I have been programming as a sideline to my normal engineering job since teaching
                            myself VBA for Excel in 2002. Once I developed enough confidence in my programming
                            skills I would find myself encountering problems in my normal role that I could see
                            a solution for. Then in my own time, I would set about resolving a programmatic answer
                            to the problem. I still find myself as excited today about my latest programs as I was
                            upon completing my first program and demonstrating it to my peers and managers (with
                            the screen updating deliberately left on) in a weekly meeting. I find it immensely
                            satisfying to create programs that will accomplish in a few seconds what would take
                            hours or even days to perform manually.

                            I have continued my self learning in the art of programming with Python, T-SQL, Access
                            VBA along with supporting programs and technologies such as Visual Studio and Git. For
                            the first time in my part time amateur programming career I am taking a course on full
                            stack web development. I am very excited to finally have people to learn with as I
                            struggle with a new bunch of languages.

                            For me, it's all about the creative solutions you can bring to make the world a better
                            place...or at least make someone's life a little easier. I also like whitewater kayaking.
